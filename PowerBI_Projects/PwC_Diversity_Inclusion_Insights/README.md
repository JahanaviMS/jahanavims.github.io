# PwC Diversity and Inclusion Insights

**Project Type:** Virtual Internship Project  
**Platform:** Power BI  

## Overview
This project is part of the PwC Virtual Internship. I built a **diversity and inclusion dashboard** to analyze workforce composition and monitor progress on inclusivity metrics.

## Key Insights
- Gender distribution showed **imbalances in senior leadership roles**.  
- Significant variance in **hiring trends across departments**.  
- Dashboard enabled monitoring of **inclusion KPIs** such as gender ratio, age group diversity, and promotions.
