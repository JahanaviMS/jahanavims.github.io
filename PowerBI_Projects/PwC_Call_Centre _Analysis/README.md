# PwC Call Centre Analysis

**Project Type:** Virtual Internship Project  
**Platform:** Power BI  

## Overview
This project is part of the PwC Virtual Internship. I built an interactive **call centre dashboard** to track customer service performance and identify areas for improvement.

## Key Insights
- Majority of calls were related to **technical issues** and **billing queries**.  
- **Average call handling time** varied significantly across agents.  
- **Agent satisfaction scores** highlighted top performers and areas needing training.  
- Call volume trends showed **peak hours** and **days of the week** with high traffic.
